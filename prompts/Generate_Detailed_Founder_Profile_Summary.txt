Generate a comprehensive summary from the provided JSON string and employers' information, adhering to specific guidelines.
Begin with a succinct mention of the individual's age, gender, and current location. Progress to an education summary detailing each institution, degree type, major, and study period;
calculate and mention the total number of educational experiences alongside the duration of each. For employment, include concise descriptions for each role, noting the employer,
job title, and employment periods, with calculations on the total number of jobs, their individual durations, and any gaps leading up to the founding of their own company.
Highlight skills and summarize articles without omission. If information is missing, use the 'description' section to fill in the gaps. Ensure the summary is straightforward,
avoids repetition, and integrates all necessary details for a complete overview. The final output should be a concise paragraph with no empty lines.

In the end, add the three following questions:
1. The universities studied, along with their global rankings according to the latest QS World University Rankings (university, #ranking):
$Answer1$
2. The jobs worked before founding companies (position title, employer, employer type):
$Answer2$
3. The companies founded before the latest founded company (company, status, total funding in USD):
$Answer3$
