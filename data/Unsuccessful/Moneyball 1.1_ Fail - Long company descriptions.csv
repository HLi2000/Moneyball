Cuff,e400e713-c943-c80c-4ec1-2e2c6b5300df,"Update from Elena Tabb about Cuff Vendor Lawsuit (7/26/16): I need to correct the info below about Elena Tabb// Volume & Tone LLC : Volume & Tone LLC along with 4 other companies (not 2) have filed a lawsuit to order the court to force Cuff into bankruptcy. Cuff owed the 5 separate companies over 1.2 million dollars (in addition to some others who did not join the suit). According to our lawyers that was the only way to force Cuff Inc. to open their books to the court so we can investigate though a 3rd part court appointed lawyer if the company misappropriated funs or had any wrong doings. Cuff Inc. and thier investors were hoping to just claim insolvency which would have allowed them to skulk away quietly. By forcing them into bankruptcy the hope is that they will be forced to let the court and eventually our lawyers see where all the money went and if the way the company was handled at the end followed the law. Also I am correcting the below misinformation about my company- My company Volume & Tone LLC (parent Company) and my consulting group LANE TABB ACCESSORIES GROUP did all the design development, sourcing, and Manufacturing for ALL of the actual Jewelry and leather pieces, We spent a year getting her ideas to be working jewelry and fashion leather pieces, manufactured them with our partner factories, shipped every piece that was on pre- order and ordered for target and Amazon and extra stock to Cuff's warehouses so that they could ship. And then they disappeared, After we had paid for the last shipment to our factories with our own money. The damages to our business currently totaling more than you can imagine which we may file a Civil case this Fall. There is a lot more to this story, and I have been quiet for the past few months as we have been collecting information both for lawyers and myself- But I am currently in the process of an article about our experience with the Cuff Product Launch, Working with a Tech startup gone wrong, as well as interesting information about the main investment firm who may or may not have caused the demise intentionally, and a cautionary tale for both Investors and small businesses. The following message appears at Cuff.io,''Unfortunately Cuff is no longer in business and therefore will not be able to fulfill any outstanding orders or process any refunds. If you are currently a Cuff customer your product should continue to function, however there will no longer be any customer or technical support.''. The announcement was unexpected, as the first generation & second generation devices can still be found for sale through online retailers like kohls.com target.com & was previously featured on Groupon. A former vendor charged with designing and hand crafting some of the letter pieces the Cuff module fits into, Elena Tabb of Volume & Tone based in NYC, says her and another vendor have filed a suit against Ms Sood & Cuff for $1.2 Million USD, as these vendors allege they were not paid for their work or materials. As this case makes it way through the court system, many customers,fans, & backers are left with more questions than answers. Please Note:POST-CLOSURE DEVICES ARE NOT RECCOMENDED FOR PURCHASE AS APP FUNCTIONALITY, DEVICE SUPPORT, CONNECTIVITY, ETC ARE NO LONGER SERVICIBLE. The purpose of this device was arguably one that needed to be designated as medical and regulated by the FDA-as such, without FDA approval, and since the company no longer offers assistance in anyway, please do not rely solely on these Cuff modules for health and safety reasons. One user who purchased from a 3rd party site reported an inability to create an account or setup her device after downloading the app on compatible devices with Android and iOS respectively. Elena suggests that core Cuff personnel aren't remorseful and one in particular was said to have been given a VP of Finance position elsewhere despite allegedly ''mispending $7.5 million in 8 months.'' Less than 1 year prior to closure, Cuff was announced as having inked a deal with XFINITY HOME, Comcast's connected home solution also featuring Skybell, Rachio, Whistle, Automatic, & August. [Depreciated]Cuff is a new line of jewelry wearables that serves as an alert system for family and friends. The collection consists of bracelets, necklaces and key chains. The line is meant to be unisex, and offers options for both men and women. Each piece is anchored by a small rectangular component called the ‚ÄúCuffLinc.‚Äù This acts as an alert system of sorts for family and friends. CuffLincs can be removed and tucked into any of the pieces in the Cuff collection. Using bluetooth technology, the CuffLinc will connect to your phone via Cuff‚Äôs app. If A wearer squeezes the Cuff, an alert will go to the designated people in the wearer‚Äôs network. If anyone in the network is wearing a Cuff, their Cuff will vibrate. If they don‚Äôt have a Cuff, they will receive a push notification to their phone with the alert with the location of the sender. You can set up which of your contacts will get an alert via the startup‚Äôs app, which also holds personal and medical information like blood type, health issues and more. Users can also program their Cuffs with different alerts for people (i.e. three taps to alert my babysitter, one tap for my husband).",,

Frustrated by the amount of manual work required to analyze and understand his marketing & sales funnel, he had an idea for a solution that would help do this automatically, providing actionable insights into what changes are needed today to grow revenue faster tomorrow. Inspired by the book The Lean Startup, he and a small team spent an entire year doing market research collecting feedback from over 150 sales & marketing leaders to make sure they were designing a solution that would work for many other businesses. The feedback was clear. Many others were experiencing the same problem, and the biggest pain point was connecting marketing activities (lead generation and marketing qualified leads) to sales (conversion to sales qualified leads/opportunities and lead response management). Since launching the software in early 2015, FunnelWise has heard from many companies that in addition to software, they also would like help with understanding what to do with their data based on what other leading organizations are doing.

Get Bizzy,b47d8dd8-58d2-4e12-8aae-844e1aef3034,"Alex and Andrew started Bizzy, a coffee brewing company that offers organic cold brew coffee. Their passion for cold brew coffee started years ago after graduating from college. At the time, both had corporate jobs, were training for a 24-hour obstacle race, and were running a group fitness company. Because of their busy schedules and drive to succeed, sleep became less important to them. In order to be their best, they needed something that could give them a quick jolt of energy. At first, they would drink anything that would keep them awake. As former college students, they started with what they knew - energy drinks. They quickly found that this was an extremely unhealthy option and one that would leave them with a hard crash once the sugar wore off. As they looked further into what was actually in these products they were disgusted at the amount of sugar and synthetic ingredients they were consuming. So, as any corporate employee would do, they turned to their trusty friend, coffee. Every morning they would wake up 15 minutes early just to brew a pot of drip coffee, but just like everything else they tried, it had several drawbacks. The coffee took way too long to brew, produced a terrible tasting product, and wasn't convenient to take with them. Three things in their mind were unacceptable. In the summer of 2012, they stumbled upon cold brew coffee. It fulfilled all of their requirements for the perfect source of energy, it was natural, sugar-free, and simple, but there was one very significant drawback, it wasn't at all convenient. To make it on their own took them 24 hours and if they wanted to buy it they had to wait in line at a coffee shop. Over the next several years their love for cold brew grew, and so did their frustration with its lack of convenience and availability. They spent the next 2-years researching a way to create the highest quality product, in the most convenient way, and in 2015 they launched Bizzy - the healthiest and most convenient coffee on the market.",,

INGU,ad8e54ae-3525-bd71-3701-e463c5ad22ea,"Currently, inline inspection in the oil and gas sector is a series of staged engineering events, designed to assess the condition of pipeline assets. It is costly, infrequent, and only addresses those lines that are within reach. In fact, it is estimated that 40% of the world‚Äôs pipelines are unpiggable. The vulnerabilities between inspections, which are typically years apart, or the inability to conduct inspections at all, puts the world‚Äôs aging pipeline infrastructure at risk. In order to address these issues, we have focused on changing the economics, the technology, and the workflow associated with inline inspection. We have introduced the industry‚Äôs first self-serve inspection model that eliminates significant engineering and downtime costs. We have developed miniature, multi sensor Pipers¬Æ technology that freely flows within any and all active pipelines, regardless of location, condition, material or configuration. This technology is capable of inspecting pipelines as small as 2 inches in diameter, and surveying for leaks, geometric defects, magnetic anomalies, and deposits in a single run. Further, we have reduced the cost of inline inspection by a factor of 10, making it possible for integrity programs to be more present, more often, across all of their assets. Finally, such accessible technology has given us the opportunity to work with a complete range of clients ‚Äì large and small, private and public ‚Äì resulting in rich datasets libraries that offer unprecedented contextual analysis and continuous advancement of our data analytics capabilities. Our approach provides clients with uninterrupted access to up-to-date condition-critical data, allowing them to optimize planning, decision-making, and actions.",,

Indow,bdfbcdb1-77af-5969-0c96-baff19d73b19,"Problem: Windows make buildings livable, but they also are a primary source of discomfort, noise penetration, and energy loss. The US DOE has surveyed 400 top energy efficiency technologies and concluded interior and exterior storm window rank #3 in their carbon reduction potential. Replacement and storm windows are expensive and unpleasant to purchase and install. Solution: Indow, of Portland, Oregon, provides building owners with attractive, affordable, easy to install (and remove), interior window inserts that block drafts 100%, reduce noise up to 70% and save 20% on heating and cooling bills. Our inserts are composed of acrylic glazing edged with our patented Compression Tube and press inside window frames without a mounting bracket. The product comes in seven grades optimized for different needs such as comfort, quiet, IR blocking, UV blocking and more. Market: In the US alone there are almost 1 billion single-pane windows and hundreds of millions of under-performing double-panes. Our comfort market is focused on owner-occupied homes built before 1950 with single-pane windows and household incomes of $200k to $1M+. Average net revenue of $360 per Indow insert and 2.5 million households fitting this customer profile yield a total US addressable comfort market of over $12 billion. More than 50% of our revenue is to window soundproofing customers blocking outside noise. These customers span a broader range of building types and demographics. The commercial building market potential is also in the tens of billions. There are vast international opportunities for comfort, noise, and energy efficiency. Competitive Advantage: No window insulation solution provides Indow‚Äôs unique combination of ease of installation, performance, noise reduction, cost, and aesthetics. Competing interior storm window solutions have inferior aesthetics, more complicated installation, and fail to deal elegantly with out-of-square window frames. Double-pane replacement and storm windows provide inferior noise reduction, are more expensive, and are very disruptive to purchase and install. Our competitive barriers are sustainable. We have received utility patents on three generations of Compression Tubing. Efforts to design around our patents will add complexity and cost. Our marketing is top of category and our proprietary IT system streamlines ordering, measuring, and manufacturing. We have defined an aggressive product and process development path, including the highest performing interior storm windows on the market, and the most cost effective ones. Go-To-Market Strategy: We sell the majority of residential revenue direct to customers via our inside sales team. We also maintain a dealer network focused on commercial projects in major metropolitan areas. New product development : We will transform the market through dramatic reductions in transaction costs as we make it easier and more affordable for customers from all walks of life to gain comfort, quiet, and energy efficiency. In Q1 2022 Indow is Beta testing a new product family which will streamline customer ordering and have a much lower entry level price.

LOCIcoin utility tokens are used exclusively within the LOCI suite of products for the purposes of searching, analyzing, staking and exchanging Intellectual Property. LOCI Search provides a unique and patented Venn Diagram IP search tool for FREE (https://www.locisearch.com/) LOCI Invention Analysis helps new inventors determine the novelty and demand (undergoing further development) for their ideas before they spend money trying to patent. This is a huge cost savings of about 95% compared to traditional patent attorney searches. LOCI Invention Analysis can also help guide inventors toward ‚Äúwhite space‚Äù where there are relatively few existing patents, where demand is high, so the inventor has the best possible chance of being awarded a patent, and/or selling their idea. Inventors can submit multiple iterations to help refine their idea and identify alternative applications of their invention. The ultimate goal of the inventor while using Invention Analysis is to achieve a optimal ‚ÄúLOCI Score‚Äù which indicates that their idea is unique, and in high demand. Once an inventor has refined their idea to feel confident that it is unique and in high demand, then they will be able to easily translate their idea into a provisional patent application using the LOCI system that is directly filed with the USPTO (in development), as well as stake their claim on the blockchain, which provides an immutable, undisputable time-stamp of the staked idea. This protects the invention for a period of 12 months at a very low cost. Visit https://loci.io for more information!",,

People, streets, cities, and planet earth are our laboratory where we conduct field experiments to blend anthropology with innovation, production and marketing through crowdsource methods.

We will follow up with similar test launches in London, Amsterdam, Barcelona, Moscow, Shanghai, and Mumbai beginning Q4 this year. There are 6bn daily commutes in the world and we aim to be the Airbnb of carpooling. EU ranked us in the top 5 among 11,000 innovation projects for H2020! What is the catch? We have an unfair advantage. We are based in Istanbul! It is crowded, and terrible by means of public transportation. Cars are 2.5 times more expensive, car fuel is 3 times more expensive than US ‚Äì yet income is low by western standards. What‚Äôs more; its road infrastructure forces 18 million people to squeeze in 4 main arteries for journeys that can take up to 2.5 hours each way. In our pilots they are much more eager to turn the daily misery of commute to a new medium for comfort, cost sharing, and social connectivity compared to elsewhere.

With Leomo Lab's sensor technology, an athlete can monitor his performance, movement and form on a display worn on the wrist or attached to a handle bar on a bicycle. The device also incorporates advanced analytics to summarise the data and provide coaching feedback while training. They named this service Leomo and its development company Lemonade Lab, Inc. Lemonade was originated by a clause ''When life hands you lemons, make lemonade'' which is used to encourage people in the U.S. Lemons is a slang which means defective product or mess. On the other hand, lemonade represents sweet and tasty drink which is loved in the U.S. Therefore, a direct translation of this clause is ''Let's make lemonade when someone hands you a trouble''. Namely, even if you face a trouble (lemon), you could try to achieve the fruit (lemonade) out of it. They love this clause. They love a positive attitude to try to convert a trouble into a success. It does not make much sense to lament a bad luck. It's better to challenge against such situation and to try to bring a positive result. They can foresee a lot of difficulties in front of us. Maybe some of them are too big to overcome. But They want to believe in us and to pursue an impossible dream of making lemonade out of lemon.",,

Matrix,d97a58dd-3820-72a3-0491-c821519504f6,"Matrix.org is an ambitious not-for-profit open source initiative defining a new open standard for decentralised, persistent and interoperable communications over the internet. Matrix.org‚Äôs aim is to fix the problem of fragmented IP-communications between devices, people and services, and make them as seamless and interoperable as possible. Matrix addresses use cases like VoIP, IoT and instant messaging but its real potential and ultimate mission is to be a generic messaging and data synchronization system for the web - allowing anyone and anything to easily communicate securely, maintaining full conversation history with no single points of control or failure. Any developer can use Matrix to easily create and host their own feature-rich real-time communication apps or add such features to an existing service whilst building on the Matrix community of users. Existing communication services can also easily join in and integrate with the Matrix ecosystem. The Matrix standard specifies simple RESTful HTTP APIs for securely transmitting and replicating JSON data between Matrix-capable clients, servers and services. Clients send data by PUTing it to a ‚Äòroom‚Äô on their server, which then replicates the data over all the Matrix servers participating in this ‚Äòroom‚Äô. This data is signed using a blockchain-style signature to mitigate tampering, and the federated traffic is encrypted with HTTPS and signed with each server‚Äôs private key to avoid spoofing. Replication follows eventual consistency semantics, allowing servers to function even if offline or after data-loss by resynchronizing missing history from other participating servers. End-to-end encryption ensures data at rest is only readable by the room participants.

Moleculera Labs,a82e4956-aab1-840e-e155-e5fa8423e481,"Moleculera Labs was founded by Drs. Craig Shimasaki and Madeleine Cunningham in 2011, to medically understand and clinically identify the underlying biological root of neurological, psychiatric, and behavioral disorders. Similar to the emergence of the immuno-oncology connection, epidemiological and research evidence demonstrates that a large portion of neuropsychiatric disorders are caused by an autoimmune dysfunction. The Company owns and operates a fully accredited clinical laboratory with its first revenue generating product‚Äîa blood panel called the Cunningham Panel‚Ñ¢ that detects brain and nervous system targeted autoimmune antibodies in patients with neurologic, psychiatric, and behavioral disorders triggered by an infection. Patients are diagnosed with PANS, PANDAS, autism spectrum disorder, ADD/ADHD, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorder, Tourette‚Äôs, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), schizophrenia, or other neurologic and psychiatric syndromes, whereas the root may be a dysfunctional immune response. Symptoms include OCD, anxiety, depression, psychosis, motor or vocal tics, verbal and non-verbal communication difficulty, deteriorating social skills, eating disorders, academic regression, and rage. These patients are typically prescribed neuropsychiatric drugs, often resulting in little or no improvement. However, once a patient is correctly diagnosed through testing, treatment is redirected towards the immune system, neuroinflammation, and subclinical infections, resulting in remarkable recoveries, sometimes after decades of suffering. Moleculera is the sole clinical laboratory performing this panel covered by two U.S. patents. The Company has received and processed over 13,000 blood specimens ordered by over 1,700 physicians in over 50 countries, all prior to launching a sales force. The Company generated $1.1 MM in 2021 and is preparing to scale for revenue expansion with expectations of revenue ~$25 MM in 4-5 years. The company is now applying this technology to autoimmune cardiovascular disease and Long-COVID symptoms. The basic research that led to the identification of these antineuronal antibody targets was studied for over 20 years in the laboratory of Dr. Madeleine Cunningham at The University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, with subsequent collaboration from the Pediatric Branch of the National Institutes of Mental Health (NIMH). Scientific and clinical results have been published in multiple top-tier peer-reviewed journals. Certain infections that have been found to trigger these autoimmune antibodies include strep, Lyme, mycoplasma, Babesia, bartonella, coxsackie virus, and others. Medical journals have reported an autoimmune response to SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), with approximately one-third of patients experiencing some neurologic or psychiatric symptoms. The patented Cunningham Panel‚Ñ¢ consists of five tests. Four which measure levels of autoantibodies directed against Dopamine D1 receptor, Dopamine D2L receptor, Lysoganglioside GM1, and Tubulin. A fifth test measures CaM Kinase II activation, a key enzyme involved in the production of neurotransmitters dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine. Autoimmune antibodies that bind to these targets interfere with or block normal neurologic activity in the brain and nervous system. The laboratory results assist a physician in making a diagnosis and identifying the appropriate therapy. In addition to individual clinicians who order the panel, the Company has provided testing to over 80 medical institution customers. In a 2020 publication in the Journal of Neuroimmunology, the Cunningham Panel demonstrated an 88% sensitivity and 92% specificity with an accuracy of 90% correlating these autoantibody elevations and neuropsychiatric symptoms before and after treatment. The Cunningham Panel aids a clinician‚Äôs treatment decision by directing them to the underlying subclinical infections and neuroimmune dysfunction, rather than simply treating symptoms. Effective treatments typically include various anti-infectives, anti-inflammatory agents and immunomodulators. Moleculera' s Test Panel generates an average realized revenue of $900 through existing CPT codes and patient billing. The Company has generated over $10 million in cumulative revenue since opening. During the COVID-19 pandemic, revenues for 2021 were $1.1 million, all prior to adding a sales force. Approximately 10% of orders come from a growing international market, with the Company receiving orders from over 1,700 clinicians. Moleculera Labs has one of the largest IRB approved and clinically annotated serum specimen biobanks of over 13,000 specimens utilized for research and development of new products for autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders. The Company has demonstrated its panel‚Äôs clinical utility in multiple neuropsychiatric disorders and have been able to predict treatment efficacy while working with pharmaceutical and research partners to assist in identifying novel drug targets. There is a clear unmet medical need and demand in this $23 billion dollar neuropsychiatric and behavioral disorder market. Moleculera recently in-licensed exclusive technology for multiple autoimmune antibody targets against the heart, which are implicated in a portion of multiple cardiovascular diseases such as heart failure, cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, and myocarditis. With this technology along with proposed clinical studies and validation in process, the Company expects to develop and commercialize two additional panels. One panel will target various cardiovascular diseases (world-wide market of $4.9 trillion) infection-triggered autoimmunity, and another panel for diagnosing and treatment-monitoring of Long-COVID (estimated at $6.5 trillion). Our precision medicine business model is fashioned after Foundation Medicine and Genomic Health, whose precision medicine companies were acquired by Roche in 2018 for $5.3 billion, and Exact Sciences in 2019 for $2.8 billion, respectively. Moleculera Labs is led by Dr. Craig Shimasaki, a serial entrepreneur with over 35 years of biotechnology experience, who began his career at Genentech. He co-founded multiple companies, participated in taking several companies public into the U.S. and the Canadian stock exchange, led five products through the FDA diagnostic approval process, and has directed two CLIA labs, raising over $30 million for these companies. Dr. Madeleine Cunningham, Chief Scientific Officer, is an internationally recognized leader in infection-induced autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders and is a tenured professor at the University of Oklahoma with over 40 years of research and over 130 authored publications in leading scientific and medical journals. Dr. James Appleman is VP of R&D and Clinical Development and has 30+ years‚Äô experience in building successful diagnostic and therapeutic companies from inception through successful exits, including a $230M exit to Roche. Mr. Fred Hiller is CFO and brings 45+ years‚Äô experience in corporate finance and accounting.

Rainbird prevents billions being lost due to inconsistent, uninformed decision making. How does Rainbird automate complex decisions? 1. Capture expertise without coding Using a visual modeller, create knowledge maps of the thought processes applied by subject matter experts in any field. Knowledge maps aren‚Äôt linear (like decision trees in robotic process automation) or opaque (like machine learning models). This means you can productise expertise and make it available at scale. 2. Ask complex questions Pose questions or scenarios to Rainbird that align with the area of knowledge covered by your map. You can do this using conversational interfaces, APIs or other systems. Rainbird will provide answers with varying levels of certainty, even when dealing with ambiguity or incomplete data. This improves the accuracy of nuanced, multidimensional analyses, like fraud detection. 3. Get explanations for answers Ask Rainbird why it‚Äôs given you a particular answer and it will show an evidence tree of its reasoning, including all considered variables and the quantitative impact of each. This ensures you can comply with regulations and enjoy the full confidence of customers.

Trevi Systems,aa7420bd-3188-fe8b-a162-961dad73df45,"Trevi Systems is a progressive energy-efficient Forward Osmosis (FO) desalination company. Trevi System has developed an innovative and highly efficient Forward Osmosis (FO) process, in order to produce clean water from saltwater, brackish water, or industrial wastewater at a much lower cost and energy use as compared to Reverse Osmosis (RO) technologies. Rather than force water through a membrane as in RO systems, FO relies on osmotic pressure to draw water across the membrane. In the FO system, the ‚Äúfeed‚Äù solution or contaminated water is pumped to one side of the semi-permeable membrane. The ‚Äúdraw‚Äù solution, which has a high concentration of a specially designed chemical and a low concentration of water relative to the feed solution, is pumped to the other side of the membrane. The water molecules are attracted or pulled through the membrane via osmotic pressure ‚Äì that is, the water molecules want to migrate from an area of high water concentration to one of low water concentration. Accordingly, water is pulled through the membrane using no energy, leaving the salts or other contaminants on the opposite side. The benefits of the Trevi FO system are numerous: it requires only a small fraction, of the electrical energy of current RO systems; it uses relatively low-cost waste heat or low-temperature heat to separate the draw chemical from the clean water; it can be customized to work under specific water conditions such as seawater, brackish water, municipal wastewater, or industrial wastewater; when used for desalination, the system can also be customized to produce brine streams of varying salt concentrations depending on the environmental requirements of the location; and it operates at ambient pressure, avoiding the extra costs of the high-pressure stainless steel plumbing required by RO systems, and the need for expensive high-pressure pumps.",,

To support and ultimately ensure delivery of business-critical applications and services, a distinct architecture has emerged. This complex structure involves dynamic resource sharing over a hyper-converged compute, storage and network physical infrastructure, all supported by a layer of virtualization technologies. This new, integrated approach to data center architecture offers tremendous operational and business advantages to organizations whose success is dependent upon reliable application service delivery. However, data center monitoring solutions and technology developments have not kept pace with this new wave in data center architecture. Current tools have reinforced the established silos that separate applications, virtual infrastructure, and physical infrastructure as well as the supporting IT teams within the data center. As a result, data center teams have no inter-silo visibility and are unable to efficiently connect the dots between infrastructure and application performance. Uila has a transformational vision that addresses this problem, and empowers data center infrastructure and application teams with a revolutionary new collaborative solution that effectively visualizes and automatically correlates application performance to virtual and physical infrastructure root cause. Monitoring application and IT infrastructure in a virtualized data center calls for an equally virtualized monitoring architecture.

The advanced Uila solution delivers faster and more accurate identification of application performance root cause, provides effective remediation, and prevents future performance degradation‚Ä¶while reducing IT total cost of ownership.",,

YouSolar,01e4041b-c273-fe93-c38f-a575a1d7d891,"Rooftop solar+battery systems are an answer to one of their biggest problems: how to expand access to electricity without harming the planet. When combined with the grid, they will create a hybrid power system that is cheaper, more reliable and much ‚Äúgreener‚Äù than the grid alone. YouSolar has the technology and business model to accelerate this transformation. Their first market is India, a country with acute power shortages that is emerging as the largest market for solar+battery systems. If you regularly need backup power and have roof space, YouSolar can provide a complete energy solution at much lower cost than electricity from a diesel generator. You will have reliable, high quality electricity with no switchover during grid outages and plenty of power when turning on appliances. Best of all, they will monitor your system 24/7 and back it up with a 5-year warranty. The worldwide market for solar systems is poised to grow exponentially. India is the hotspot. In July 2015 India announced a goal of 40 GW of power from rooftop solar by 2022 (equivalent to 10 million systems). However, two big challenges must be overcome: How to integrate these systems with the grid, and how to finance them. YouSolar‚Äôs solar+battery systems and secure leasing model are the answers. Thanks to this proprietary intelligence, the YouSolar system uses nearly all the solar energy generated by the solar array and, thus, does not have to be ‚Äúnet metered‚Äù. The system takes power from the grid, but never sends power to the grid. So, there is no need to get a permit from the utility. YouSolar‚Äôs system can remain functioning at all times, unlike net metered systems which must shut down during power cuts (for safety). Being available during power cuts and requiring no permits are big advantages in markets like India.",,

Zymochem,2da7eb3b-c559-9657-657e-57dcbd247f3e,"The world they live in is built from petroleum. The paints on their walls, the carpets in their homes, the tires on their cars, the plastics for everyday consumer goods ‚Äì these and many more products are made from chemicals that are mostly made from petroleum, creating a $3 trillion/yr industry. To fulfill their dependency on petroleum, they do crazy things like setting up oil rigs in the middle of the ocean and drilling several miles into the ocean floor! They‚Äôve done these things because they have had no alternative to meet their needs. Not anymore! Over the past decade, advances in engineering microorganisms have afforded us the opportunity to make the same chemicals that are traditionally made from petroleum. Instead of requiring raw materials buried deep within the earth, microbes can use abundant and renewable sources of carbon such as sugars during processes akin to brewing beer. Despite the numerous advantages, making chemicals this way at the industrial level is still rare. This is because it‚Äôs still more expensive than using petroleum for producing the chemicals. Although a few challenges need to be solved to usher in the era of renewable chemicals, a fundamental constraint that limits the economic competitiveness of using microbes is the loss of at least 33% of the carbon as carbon dioxide waste during the fermentation ‚Äì think of this as the head on your beer. Because of this carbon loss, potential product is simply not made. In technical terms, the maximum achievable yields are 67%. As sugars are the most expensive component of a bioprocess, making the carbon dioxide waste translates to as much as 20% of total costs, which severely hampers the economics of the bioprocess and its competitiveness with petroleum-based production methods. At ZymoChem, they are re-imagining the microbe, one that is designed to eliminate (or substantially reduce) carbon loss during the production of chemicals. To do this, they had to design a completely new biosynthetic pathway ‚Äì one that doesn‚Äôt exist in nature ‚Äì to make the chemicals. Each individual step of this pathway is designed to not lose carbon as carbon dioxide, enabling their biosynthetic pathway to retain all of the sugar‚Äôs carbon into the final chemical product. This carbon conservation allows their approach to have superior theoretical yields, up to 50% better than existing state-of-the-art technology! In turn, their technology has the potential to substantially lower production costs and drastically improve cost-competitiveness for making a variety of chemicals from renewable sources, even at today's oil prices.",,

Led by experienced entrepreneurs, who together blend their technology, commercial and leadership skills into a world beating team, the company develops and markets Wattwave, a unique powerline communications protocol designed to be the robust, efficient and secure communications backbone for smart buildings. Unlike competing wireless and wired technologies, Wattwave offers the long-range, robust, low cost and easy-to-embed communications needs of smart appliances, lighting and heating controls. As a powerline-based technology, Wattwave is far less susceptible to signal interference and propagation issues in homes, and it was designed from the ground up to offer unparalleled range. Wattwave is also ten times cheaper to embed than competing technologies such as ZigBee, making it a very attractive proposition for OEMs looking to develop connected Smart Home devices, in particular lower cost devices such as LED light bulbs or smartplugs. Four patents are pending on core principles of Wattwave, offering enModus strong IP protection. After raising ¬£150,000 in Angel funding in 2010 and a first venture capital round of ¬£1 million in 2011, enModus recently raised a further ¬£1.5m of investment which will allow the company to cost-optimise Wattwave and take it to market. Our ultimate goal is for enModus to become the leading provider of powerline chipsets and software technology for smart appliances and smart building solutions ‚Äì similar in business strategy and approach to Qualcomm CDMA Technologies in the wireless market. enModus is a graduate of the SETsquared start-up incubator, and is a member of Microsoft's BizSpark and ARM's Connected Community programmes.",,
