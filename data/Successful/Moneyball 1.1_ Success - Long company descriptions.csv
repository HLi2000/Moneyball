Airbase,a882136a-ca5b-44a4-9a54-03d3a37cb690,"Airbase is the only spend management platform that scales for companies from founding to IPO and beyond. It brings together three products: a comprehensive accounts payable automation system, a leading-edge corporate card program, and fully automated employee expense reimbursements. Simply put, it handles every dollar of non-payroll spend that leaves a company, from initial request for spend, to booking to the general ledger. Spend management is a different approach and a new way of thinking about how companies spend money. It shifts the relationship between employees and the budget by building accountability into fast-paced workflows and supporting ownership of spending, which are especially vital functions for a distributed workforce. Companies customize approval workflows to ensure the appropriate routing of requests while building an audit trail of compliance for every purchase. Approvals occur in Slack, email, or the Airbase mobile app so that approvers can quickly review and approve or ask questions without having to leave their working communication environment. Accounting automation tools for scheduling, accruing, amortizations, and categorizing transactions save time and eliminate errors. A full selection of payment types, including virtual cards, physical cards, checks, ACH, and vendor credits, all from one control center, make AP teams efficient and even open opportunities to optimize returns by selecting payment types that generate cash back whenever possible. When every dollar of non-payroll spend is handled on one platform, actual spending against the budget can be viewed any day of the week by all stakeholders. Airbase improves operations across the whole company. Employees are empowered to safely and easily get the resources they need to be productive. Managers have oversight and control of their budgets. Finance teams are more efficient with accounting automation. Leadership has access to real-time data for better decision-making. All benefit from Airbase‚Äôs well-designed and intuitive user interface that is easy to onboard and simple to use. Finance teams in small and mid-market companies are underserved by existing process automation tools for accounts payable and expense management. The resulting cobbled-together solutions, inefficient processes, and manual workflows place strain on finance teams and can confuse or frustrate employees. Airbase‚Äôs single platform solution can replace many of the software tools that are widely used, including spreadsheets, Expensify, Bill.com, Brex, and AMEX. This replacement streamlines processes, eliminates cross-platform reconciliation needs, and even reveals wasted spend. The Airbase platform consolidates three functional areas without asking users to compromise on the quality or functionality expected from a best-of-breed solution. This allows companies to enjoy the benefits of having everything available in one place and standardized to the same workflows without missing the value of legacy point solutions. Current practices can stymie growth, degrade decision-making, and relegate finance staff to low-value manual work. Airbase gives companies the efficiencies they need to grow, from founding to IPO, without investing heavily in back-office staff. The Airbase spend management solution unlocks trapped talent, provides visibility and control over all non-payroll spend, shortens the close, and provides better budget management so you can build a great company."

C4 Therapeutics,31dc075f-2fed-6cc9-0a7b-7dd0a7059154,"C4 is building on the knowledge with synthetic chemical compounds which it calls Degronimids. These compounds can be engineered and linked together to bind with many molecular targets that today‚Äôs drugs can‚Äôt bind with, Cohen said. The key insight, he said, is that the scientific founders have discovered a way to bind with select disease-causing proteins, and flag them as cellular trash, so that the ordinary proteasome garbage disposal system can get rid of them. Selecting the precise disease-related proteins to send to the trash is obviously critical, because any drug like this could cause serious side effects if it sent healthy proteins involved in normal cell processes to the trash. C4 Therapeutics is developing a new class of targeted protein degradation (TPD) therapeutics for the treatment of a broad range of diseases. Our Degronimid‚Ñ¢ platform incorporates highly selective small molecule binders to target disease-causing proteins and facilitate their rapid destruction and clearance from the cell through the natural ubiquitin/proteasome system (UPS). Because of this distinctive mechanism, Degronimids are capable of hitting many more targets, including those previously thought to be undruggable, while reducing the potential for drug resistance. The broad applicability of Degronimids, and our chemical biology platform designed for accelerated validation, have the potential to make an unprecedented impact across many diseases through multiple industry collaborations as well as proprietary programs.

Loxo Oncology is committed to bringing targeted cancer therapies rapidly into the clinic that have an opportunity for outsized clinical effects in genetically defined patient populations. Loxo Oncology derives its company name from an attendant of the Greek goddess Artemis, who represented the concept of trajectory in the sport of archery. It is an exciting time to develop cancer drugs. Diagnostic methods are yielding strong clues about which cancer features are actionable, ‚Äúdriver mutations,‚Äù in contrast to those merely along for the ride as ‚Äúpassenger mutations.‚Äù In the last five years, these insights have transformed the standard of care in melanoma, lung cancer and other cancers. Picking a target is just the first step in building a cancer drug. Good chemists build good drugs. The physical properties of a compound have much to do with its ultimate success or failure. Is it stable? Is it soluble? Is it absorbed? Does it reach its target? Does it engage the target? Does it cause toxicity elsewhere in the body before it achieves maximum efficacy in the cancer? In our opinion, drugs that achieve excellent exposure in the body and are highly specific for their intended targets have the highest chances of success. Once an attractive target is selected and a drug with best-in-class properties is constructed, setting up the right clinical development plan is of utmost importance. Our goal is to generate a clinical path that reflects the underlying scientific hypothesis that made the drug interesting in the first place. This often means developing the drug in a population of patients whose tumors possess a specific genetic vulnerability targeted by the drug. Loxo Oncology was built around a team of full-time professionals and engaged scientific advisors who are aligned in choosing the most actionable targets, and pursuing them through disciplined clinical trial approaches. Our license and collaboration agreement with Array Biopharma and our experienced team allows us to construct drugs with best-in-class properties from the ground up."

OakNorth,6de6c958-48e5-d663-08ae-b5c06229aab1,"In 2005, our co-founders, Rishi Khosla and Joel Perlman, were looking for a working capital facility to support their growing business, Copal Partners, a financial research firm they‚Äôd founded three years previously. They approached numerous high-street banks and kept getting variations of the same response ‚Äì ‚Äúthe computer says ‚ÄòNo‚Äô‚Äù. Despite being a profitable business with strong cash flow and retained clients, none of the commercial banks were willing to lend to them. It was too small a ticket to offset the costs the bank would incur in doing a fundamental assessment of their business and structuring a finance facility for their needs. A few months later through one of their institutional client‚Äôs special situations desk, they managed to secure 100x the amount of debt for a dividend recap. So, an institutional division of a bank was able to support them, but the commercial lending part of the bank was not. This experience stuck with them. After they‚Äôd scaled Copal Partners to a 3,000-employee business and sold it to Moody‚Äôs Corporation (NYSE: MCO) in 2014, they set out to address the funding gap they had experienced first-hand and empower the Missing Middle, through launching OakNorth.

Scipher Medicine,878b9b1b-66e3-4db8-ba57-a0fad7294f75,"Scipher Medicine develops a healthcare platform designed to determine which drug will work best for each patient. The company is committed to transforming the way providers prescribe drugs, as well as the way manufacturers, develop new drugs. They are building a molecular map of all protein interactions that identifies genomic signatures and links those to disease and predictive treatment outcomes. Using a simple blood sample to analyze RNA, Scipher Medicine can predict if a patient is likely to respond to a targeted therapy before therapy is prescribed. This insight allows patients to start the most effective therapy from day one. For its first commercial product, they have developed PrismRA¬Æ, a first-of-its-kind blood test that can predict which patients with rheumatoid arthritis are less likely to respond to TNFi therapies such as Humira¬Æ and Enbrel¬Æ so that such patients can go on alternative approved drugs. Scipher Medicine is building the future of patient treatment. Most patients who are prescribed blockbuster therapies today don't respond to treatment, costing the healthcare industry billions in wasted drugs while patients continue to suffer. Scipher's platform identifies which drug will work based on the patient's fundamental disease biology, and not based on symptoms, disease classification, or medical bias. A routine blood test predicts which drug he/she will respond to, with our first product focusing on rheumatoid arthritis, ensuring that the most optimal treatment is prescribed from day one. The molecular data generated by our tests are then used to fuel novel target discovery to address a clear unmet medical need in patients who do not respond to any existing therapy."

DMD is a progressive, irreversible and ultimately fatal disease that affects approximately one in every 3,500 to 5,000 live male births and has an estimated prevalence of 10,000 to 15,000 cases in the United States alone. There is no cure for DMD and, for the vast majority of patients, there are no satisfactory symptomatic or disease-modifying treatments. Our lead product candidate, SGT-001, is a gene transfer under development to restore functional dystrophin protein expression in patients' muscles. Based on our preclinical program, we believe the mechanism of action of SGT-001 has the potential to slow or even halt the progression of DMD. In 2015, we began exclusively licensing the elements of the construct for SGT-001 and other elements of our gene transfer program from the University of Michigan, the University of Missouri and the University of Washington. SGT-001 has been granted Rare Pediatric Disease Designation in the US and Orphan Drug Designations in both the US and EU.

The group is primarily focused on Africa and Latin America but is open to opportunities in Europe and Asia. The first acquired assets were successfully taken over from Hess Corporation in 2017. The Okume and Ceiba fields are located in both shallow and deep water in the Rio Muni basin of Equatorial Guinea. At the time of the takeover, the asset was producing 42,000 barrels of oil per day.

Yieldstreet,f53350b3-80f6-3ca7-3f45-c4fab4102239,"Yieldstreet is a management platform that provides institutional investors with access to income-generating investment products. Founded in 2015, Yieldstreet gives individuals access to alternative investments that have traditionally been off-limits to the average investor. With over $2.5 billion invested across multiple asset classes, Yieldstreet is changing the way people generate passive income by lowering and removing the barriers that historically kept these lucrative opportunities far out of reach. In 2013, founders Milind Mehere and Michael Weisz were frustrated that many investment strategies were typically reserved only for institutions and the ultra-wealthy. Typically, the average investor was left to choose between the stock market and bonds with falling yields - with few options in between. Asset-based investments had longer hold periods and a higher barrier of entry, keeping them well out of reach of accredited investors ‚Äî even more so for unaccredited investors. As a result, they decided to leverage the growing fintech disruption to give more people access to these previously restricted alternative investments. Milind‚Äôs background in building companies, combined with Michael‚Äôs decade-plus experience within investing and fund management, formed the core of Yieldstreet. Passion for their investors and employees, as well as a willing embrace of innovation, has been part of Yieldstreet‚Äôs identity from the beginning. Each decision to leverage a new technology, investment strategy, or originate a new deal is made with the goal of putting investors first. That drive has propelled Yieldstreet across all 50 states, crossing $100M invested in less than eight quarters, with the $1B milestone coming only three years later. In 2019, Yieldstreet‚Äôs membership had grown to 100,000, and a savings account for members was launched. Yieldstreet, since its launch in 2015, has not deviated from its goal to change investing for the better, nor has it slowed down. Yieldstreet was ranked as number 46 on the Inc. 5000 list of the fastest-growing companies and has been recognized by Built In as one of the Best Places to Work. Yieldstreet today delivers wealth generation options and alternative investments for more than 330,000 investors and has returned more than $1.3 billion in principal/interest. Many alternative investment platforms only focus on one asset class, such as real estate or art. Yieldstreet‚Äôs offerings, accessed through cash or a low-fee IRA, cover a wide range of asset classes ‚Äî art, real estate, legal, corporates, consumer, and commercial, via single investments or funds. Yieldstreet also offers its members short-term notes on offerings with a hold period between 3 and 6 months, which generally boast higher interest rates than money markets and CDs.
